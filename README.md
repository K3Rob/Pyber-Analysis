# Pyber-Challenge

## Overview of the analysis:

Using the data provided by Pyber, the various rates for fares of rides were compared by different sizes of cities. Additional data was organized regarding the total number of drivers and rides given, then the average fare per driver and per ride was calculated.

## Results:

The city sizes break down into three categories; Rural, Suburban, and Urban. [Total Fare by City Type]() gives a nice take away of where the bulk of fares for Pyber come from. Rural comes in at the bottom with the lowest total fares, forseable due to having the lowest number of total rides. However, it has the largest average fare per ride and per driver of the three bins. Suburban hits nicely in the middle of the three but produces significantly more fares than Rural. While Urban has the highest in fares, braking the data down further, [Summary Data]() shows that the reason for this is largely the number number of total rides. However, the average fare per ride and per driver is significantly less in urban areas as there are far more drivers than there is demand for rides. Out of the three it has the lowest average fare per driver despite having the largest portion of rides.

## Summary:

First recommendation is to either push marketing, or cut drivers in urban areas to even out the supply demand. Maybe have promotional events at lower cost or partner with local businesses such as bars and restaurants. Either way you have far more drivers than what the current demand is.

Following on that, pricing may be an issue at least in Urban areas. Cutting price could increase total demand, more exploration may need done to really investigate this.

Finally, in Suburban areas you may need to work on finding more drivers to match the demand. If the number of drivers gets to low it could impact wait times for customers and drive down demand.
